Immediately remove from the heat and leave to stand until the milk solids have separated from the whey. Strain the mixture using the prepared sieve, then rinse the milk solids in the cloth under cold running water (this will remove any lingering vinegar flavour). Gather up the edges of the cloth to enclose the milk solids, and gently squeeze to remove the excess liquid. Tie a knot in the cloth, hang it over the sink tap and leave to strain for 1 hr.",

Roll a small portion of the dough into a smooth ball using your palms (the ball should be about 2-3cm and about 25g). Repeat with the remaining dough.",

Warm over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to the boil and cook for about 10 mins until the mixture thickens into a sticky syrup.",

Remove to a plate using a slotted spoon and leave to cool completely, then sprinkle with saffron threads or chopped pistachios. Chill until set and cold, then serve."

To keep the clementines submerged in the syrup, cut out a circle of greaseproof paper to fit into the pan and place over the fruit. Cook over a low heat for 1 hr until glossy and translucent. Remove and spread out over greaseproof paper to cool.",

            "step 1 First, make the cake. Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a 23cm loose bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Allow the chocolate to slowly melt, then set aside to cool a little.",
            "step 2 Meanwhile, blitz the hazelnuts in a food processor until roughly chopped, then add the sugars and blitz again to a fine, sandy consistency. Tip into a mixing bowl and add the 1 whole egg and 5 egg yolks. This will be a very stiff batter, but with a bit of elbow grease, it will combine. When well incorporated, beat in the melted chocolate.",
            "step 3 Put the remaining egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until they form medium peaks. Scoop a quarter of the egg whites onto the batter and beat it in to incorporate, then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins. A skewer inserted in the centre should come out reasonably clean, but the best indication that it is done is a smooth top with perhaps a few cracks, and a subtle springiness to the cake when gently prodded. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely in the tin.",
            "step 4 To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the cream and butter in a small saucepan and heat until the butter melts, but don\u2019t let it boil. Pour it over the chocolate and leave for 1-2 mins to melt, then stir to form a smooth, glossy ganache. When the cake has cooled, remove from the tin and place it on a cake stand or platter. When the ganache has cooled to a spreadable consistency, spread generously over the entire surface of the cake \u2013 as neatly or as messily as desired.",
            "step 5 To make the hazelnut spikes, place a large saucepan over a medium heat to get hot. Add the sugar and continue heating until dissolved. Increase heat and bubble, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel turns a gorgeous amber colour \u2013 but don\u2019t stir as this will cause the caramel to crystallise. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the caramel to cool and thicken to the consistency of golden syrup \u2013 if it sets too solid, simply place it over a low heat to melt again.",
            "step 6 Use a cocktail stick or wooden skewer to push into each hazelnut \u2013 make sure that you don\u2019t push it in where the seam is or the hazelnut will split. Place a sheet of baking parchment on the floor directly underneath your work surface \u2013 this will catch any drops of caramel. Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake."

            "step 2 Heat oven to 200C/180C/gas 6 (or put them in when you turn it up for the turkey). Pour oil into a deep roasting tin to give an even layer of about 0.5cm. Place the tin in the oven for 5 mins to heat the oil, then remove from the oven. One at a time and working methodically (starting at one corner of the roasting tin and lining them up as you go) place each potato in the oil and use a spoon to turn it so it\u2019s completely coated. Don\u2019t worry about the oil cooling down too much. Once all the potatoes are in the tin in a single layer, not touching, place the tin in the oven and cook for 40 mins, undisturbed.",
            "step 3 Remove from the oven and \u2013 again, meticulously \u2013 turn each potato. Return to the oven for 20 mins, then repeat the potato-turning process again. If, at this stage, your other side dishes allow you to, turn the oven up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and give the potatoes a final 20 mins. By now you should have potatoes that are everything a roastie should be: deep, golden and crunchy on the outside with an extra-fluffy middle \u2013 just sprinkle with a little sea salt to serve."

Put in the oven for 15 mins until golden brown. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve. If freezing, defrost in the fridge and reheat in the microwave."

When all the sugar has been incorporated, the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks. Add the vinegar and whisk again briefly. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles. Scatter the almonds over, saving a few to serve on top once assembled. Bake for 1 hr, then leave to cool in the oven.",

Toss the fruit with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10-15 mins. Pour the cream, amaretto, almond extract and remaining icing sugar into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped. Use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over a third of the cream and scatter with some strawberries and cherries. Top with the remaining meringues, cream and fruit, finishing the top layer with the whole strawberries and cherries. Scatter over the remaining almonds and serve. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 day."

Line the base and sides with baking parchment, ensuring the sides are at least 2cm tall. The easiest way to do this is by snipping a small diagonal cut into each corner of the parchment and folding them in against the tin.",
            "step 2 Heat a small pan of water until bubbling, then turn the heat to low and set a heatproof bowl on top, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Tip in the chopped dark chocolate and 75ml warm water and melt for 5-10 mins, stirring every now and then, until you have a smooth, even consistency.",
            "step 3 Separate the eggs into two large bowls, add a pinch of salt to the egg whites and beat using an electric whisk for 4-5 mins until doubled in size and holding soft peaks.",
            "step 4 Add the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk using the electric whisk (no need to wash it first) for a few minutes to create a mousse-like consistency. Slowly pour in the melted chocolate and beat until smooth, about 1 min.",
            "step 5 Using a large metal spoon, add a scoop of the beaten egg whites to the chocolatey yolks and mix to loosen the consistency. Add the remaining egg whites, and gently fold the ingredients together, scooping the spoon under the mixture then lifting and cutting through while turning the bowl, until you have a fluffy, chocolate mousse-like consistency, with no pockets of egg white. Be careful not to overmix as you want to retain as much air in the mixture as possible. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, gently ease it out to the edges using a spatula , and level the top. Bake for 18-20 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
            "step 6 Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 5 mins. Meanwhile, lay a large sheet of baking parchment on your work surface and dust with cocoa powder. In one swift movement, flip the cake onto the cocoa-dusted surface. Cover with a tea towel and leave to cool for 30 mins-1 hr.",
            "step 7 Meanwhile, for the filling, tip the raspberries into a pan with 1 tbsp of the icing sugar. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat and cook for 2-3 mins until juicy. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool, then chill until you\u2019re ready to assemble.",
            "step 8 Pour the cream and remaining 2 tbsp icing sugar into a bowl. Beat using an electric whisk until the cream holds peaks, about 1-2 mins \u2013 too soft and it will spill out of the cake, too firm and it will be difficult to spread, so do keep an eye on it.",
            "step 9 Remove the tea towel from the cake. With one of the shorter ends facing you, spread the pistachio butter over the surface, leaving a 1-2cm border on the nearest edge to you. Top with the whipped cream, then spoon over the cooled raspberries and their juice. Use the parchment to help you fold this shorter edge back on itself into the cake, then roll the roulade up tightly, keeping the parchment on the outside the whole time and using it to help secure it into a nice tight roll. Chill for at least 30 mins. Will keep frozen for up to a month.",

To decorate, break off 25g white chocolate and melt in short bursts in the microwave , for about 1 min, or following the same method in step 2. To make chocolate curls, hold a knife at a 45-degree angle to the surface of the chocolate bar and pull it towards you. Drizzle the melted chocolate over the roulade, then pile milk and white chocolate curls on top and scatter over the chopped pistachios.",

It should roll easily into a ball without sticking. If it does stick, continue heating the mixture over a gentle heat for a few more minutes. While the dough is still warm but not too hot to handle, spread out on the tray and allow to cook for around 15 mins.",

Put a few drops of ghee over the flattened dough. With a rolling pin, gently roll out the dough into a rough square to a thickness of about 1 cm.",

The kaju katli now needs to set for about 1 hr at room temperature, after which it's ready to serve. They should be set to a soft fudge-like consistency."

            "step 1 Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease a 33 x 23cm Swiss roll tin and line with baking parchment, then grease the parchment too. Tip the chocolate into a heatproof bowl and place it over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave to melt, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat and allow to cool a little (alternatively, melt it in short bursts in the microwave).",
            "step 2 Put the egg whites in a large, clean bowl, and the yolks and sugar in another. With very clean beaters, whisk the whites until they are just holding soft peaks. Transfer the beaters to the yolks bowl (no need to wash them) and beat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is thick and pale.",
            "step 3 Add a large spoonful of whites to the yolks and mix with a large metal spoon to loosen the yolks a little. Add the remaining whites and gently fold into the yolks, avoiding knocking out too much air.",
            "step 4 When nearly all incorporated, sieve the cocoa over the surface, scatter over the almonds and pour in the melted chocolate. Continue folding until the mixture is well combined, then scrape into your tin. Spread the mixture to the edges and level the surface. Bake for 15-18 mins on the middle shelf of the oven until the surface is crisp and the cake feels springy.",
            "step 5 While still warm, turn the roulade out onto a large piece of baking parchment, removing the parchment you used to bake the roulade on. With a small serrated knife, make a shallow incision about 1cm in from one of the shorter edges, making sure that you don\u2019t cut all the way thorough. Starting from this end, roll up as tightly as you can, bending the cut piece inwards to get the centre of the roll tight, using the baking parchment to help you and stop the layers sticking. Leave to set and cool.",
            "step 6 Tip the mascarpone, cream, Malibu (if using) and icing sugar into a bowl and whisk until softly whipped. Carefully unroll the roulade \u2013 it will crack in places, but don\u2019t worry. Spread a third of the cream all over the surface, leaving a border of about 1.5cm all the way around. Drizzle the passion fruit curd all over the surface and top evenly with the passion fruit flesh.",
            "step 7 Starting from the end that you used before, re-roll the roulade as tightly as you can, bending the cut piece into the cream to get the centre of the roll tight. Place the roulade, seam-side down, on a serving plate or board and spread the remaining cream all over the outside. Press the coconut flakes all over the top and sides, and dust with a little gold glitter, if you like. Chill and serve within a few hours. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2 days."

            "step 5 Using a ladle or large serving spoon, drop in 3 spoonfuls of batter, easing it out gently in the pan to make pancakes that are about 12cm across. Cook for 2 mins on the first side or until bubbles pop over most of the surface. Loosen with a palette knife, then flip over the pancakes and cook for 1 min more or until puffed up and firm. Transfer to the oven to keep warm, if you need to, but don\u2019t stack the pancakes too closely. Cook the rest of the batter, using a little more oil each time. Serve warm with sliced banana, berries, toasted nuts and a good drizzle of maple syrup or honey."

Tip into a mixing bowl and add the 1 whole egg and 5 egg yolks. This will be a very stiff batter, but with a bit of elbow grease, it will combine. When well incorporated, beat in the melted chocolate.",

Scoop a quarter of the egg whites onto the batter and beat it in to incorporate, then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins. A skewer inserted in the centre should come out reasonably clean, but the best indication that it is done is a smooth top with perhaps a few cracks, and a subtle springiness to the cake when gently prodded. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely in the tin.",
            "step 4 To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the cream and butter in a small saucepan and heat until the butter melts, but don\u2019t let it boil. Pour it over the chocolate and leave for 1-2 mins to melt, then stir to form a smooth, glossy ganache. When the cake has cooled, remove from the tin and place it on a cake stand or platter. When the ganache has cooled to a spreadable consistency, spread generously over the entire surface of the cake \u2013 as neatly or as messily as desired.",
            "step 5 To make the hazelnut spikes, place a large saucepan over a medium heat to get hot. Add the sugar and continue heating until dissolved. Increase heat and bubble, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel turns a gorgeous amber colour \u2013 but don\u2019t stir as this will cause the caramel to crystallise. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the caramel to cool and thicken to the consistency of golden syrup \u2013 if it sets too solid, simply place it over a low heat to melt again.",
            "step 6 Use a cocktail stick or wooden skewer to push into each hazelnut \u2013 make sure that you don\u2019t push it in where the seam is or the hazelnut will split. Place a sheet of baking parchment on the floor directly underneath your work surface \u2013 this will catch any drops of caramel. Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake."

Mix together using a spatula and, as it starts to come together, use your hands to bring it together into a slightly sticky ball. Cover and set aside.",
            "step 2 To make the roasted cauliflower, tip the cauliflower onto a large baking tray, drizzle with the oil, then sprinkle with garam masala and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix so the cauliflower is well coated and set aside.",
            "step 3 To make the dhal, place a large pan with a lid on a medium heat and add the oil. Tip in the leek and cook for a few minutes to soften. Mix in the ginger paste, chilli flakes, turmeric, curry powder and garam masala and cook for 1 min. Pour in the chopped tomatoes, coconut milk, stock and lentils, then stir in. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 mins, stirring occasionally so it doesn\u2019t stick.",
            "step 4 Meanwhile, put the cauliflower in the oven and roast for around 25-30 mins until softer and starting to colour, turning halfway.",
            "step 5 To make the naan, knead the dough on a well-floured surface briefly until it's smooth, combined and no longer sticky. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a portion of dough into an oval 3mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. The higher the heat, the more bubbles you\u2019ll get in the naan. Once heated, carefully transfer the naan to the dry frying pan using a fish slice. Leave to cook on one side for 2 mins or until nicely browned, then flip and cook for 1 min. After flipping, press down firmly on the naan using a spatula \u2013 this encourages it to puff up a little. Repeat using the rest of the dough.",
            "step 6 Once the dhal is ready, the lentils will be tender. Stir through the spinach to wilt and season to taste. Top the dhal with roasted cauliflower and serve with a naan on the side. To freeze, freeze the dhal and naan separately. Reheat the dhal in the microwave and the naan in the oven."

Put the wasabi, if using, and salmon in a single line at the bottom of the nori on the area without the rice, then add half the avocado strips alongside, followed by the crabmeat in a line next to the avocado. It should all fit on to the clear area of nori just below the rice.",
            "step 4 Holding the filling in place with your index fingers, start rolling the mat from the bottom edge of the nori towards the top of the rice edge. Keep rolling, holding the roll in place, 3 or 4 times, making sure that it's tightly rolling so that there are no gaps between the fillings and the nori.",

Scoop the pips and pulp into a sieve over the pan and squeeze out as much juice as possible, then tie the pulp and pips in the muslin. Shred the remaining peel and pith, either by hand with a sharp knife or in a food processor (a food processor will give very fine flecks rather than strips of peel). Add the shredded peel and muslin bag to the pan along with the water. Leave to soak overnight. This helps to extract the maximum amount of pectin from the fruit pulp, which will give a better set. It also helps to soften the peel, which will reduce the amount of cooking needed.",
            "step 2 Put the pan over a medium heat, then bring up to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 1\u00bd-2 hrs, until the peel has become very soft. (The cooking time will be affected by how thickly you have cut the peel.) To see if the peel is ready, pick out a thicker piece and press it between your thumb and finger. It should look slightly see-through and feel soft when you rub it.",
            "step 3 Carefully remove the muslin bag, allow to cool slightly, then, wearing the rubber gloves, squeeze out as much liquid as possible to extract the pectin from the fruit pulp. Discard the bag and weigh the simmered peel mixture. There should be between 775-800g; if less, then top up with water to 775g.",
            "step 4 Put 4 small plates in the freezer, ready to use when testing for setting point. Add the sugar to the pan, then put over a low heat. Warm gently so that the sugar dissolves completely, stirring occasionally. Do not boil, before the sugar is dissolved.",
            "step 5 Increase the heat and bring up to the boil but do not stir while the marmalade is boiling. After about 5 mins the marmalade will start to rise up the pan (it may drop back and then rise again) and larger bubbles will cover the surface. After 8-10 mins boiling, test for setting point. Times will vary according to the size of the pan \u2013 in a large pan this takes 7-8 mins, in other pans it may take 12-15 mins. As setting point can be easily missed it\u2019s better to test too early than too late.",
            "step 6 To test the setting point: take the pan off the heat and allow the bubbles to subside. Take a plate from the freezer and spoon a little liquid onto the plate, then return to the freezer for 1 min. Push the marmalade along the plate with your finger. If setting point has been reached then the marmalade surface will wrinkle slightly and the marmalade won\u2019t run back straight away. If it\u2019s not at setting point, return to the heat and boil again for 2 mins before re-testing. Repeat until setting point is reached. If you have a sugar thermometer, setting point is reached at 105C, but it\u2019s good to do the plate test as well.",
            "step 7 Leave the marmalade to stand for 10 mins or until starting to thicken. If there\u2019s any scum on the surface, spoon it off. Transfer the marmalade to sterilised jars. Cover with a wax disc (wax side down) and seal. When cold, label the jars and store in a cool, dark cupboard. The marmalade should keep for up to a year."

Reduce to a gentle simmer, add the orange slices and cook for 1 hr-1 hr 10 mins or until the pith is translucent, turning occasionally. Line a baking tray with parchment. Carefully remove the slices from the syrup, place on the prepared tray and set aside to dry (at least 8 hrs) before cutting in half. Reserve the syrup.",
            "step 2 Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly grease a loaf tin (mine was 900g) with olive oil and line with a strip of baking parchment.",
            "step 3 Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs (do not blitz them too much or they will become oily), then add to a bowl along with the orange zest, a pinch of salt and the flour, baking powder and cocoa. Mix together until evenly combined.",
            "step 4 Pour the oil and the orange juice into a jug and mix together. Put the eggs and sugar in a tabletop mixer or large bowl and whisk together for 5-10 mins or until the mixture has tripled in volume and holds a ribbon on the surface when the beaters are lifted out. Slowly pour the oil mixture into the egg mixture and fold together until combined.",
            "step 5 Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture in 3 or 4 additions, folding together until combined. You can\u2019t sieve this mixture over the eggs because of the hazelnuts, but try not to dump the flour in one place \u2013 you need to be careful and fold the batter to retain its lightness. Once fully combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
            "step 6 Prick the top of the cake all over, then pour over 5 tbsp of the reserved orange syrup. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Trim the top of the cake (keep this for a mini trifle) and turn out, cut-side down, onto a serving platter.",
            "step 7 To decorate, pour the orange juice into a small pan and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, pour the orange juice over and stir together to form a smooth ganache. Set aside in the fridge until thickened, about 20-25 mins. Tip the hazelnuts into a small bowl and add the gold powder with a dash of water, stirring together to coat. Put the ganache in a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Pipe in peaks over the top of the cake, decorating with the golden hazelnuts and the orange slices. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."

Bring a large saucepan of water to a simmer and add the bicarbonate of soda. Lower the pork into the water, poach gently for 5 mins, then remove it from the water and leave to cool to room temperature.",
            "step 2 Meanwhile, toast the fennel seeds and chilli flakes in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1-2 mins, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Grind the spices in a spice grinder or with a pestle and mortar, then mix with 1 tbsp fine sea salt.",
            "step 3 Once the pork has cooled, turn it skin-side down and pierce the underside of the meat all over with a knife. Rub the meat with the spiced salt rub, cover and put it in the fridge for at least 8 hrs or overnight. Can be prepared 24 hours ahead.",
            "step 4 The next day, make your stuffing. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the onion and fennel. Season and cook gently over a low heat for 10 mins. Add the coriander seeds and garlic, and cook for another 2 mins, then add the mince. Cook for 8-10 mins until the mince is browned. Set aside and leave to cool.",
            "step 5 Transfer the mince and onion mix to a bowl and add the sourdough, pine nuts, orange zest, apricots, herbs, lemon juice and nutmeg. Season well, then mix together thoroughly with your hands. Add the egg and mix again.",
            "step 6 Lie the pork belly on a board, skin-side down. Form the stuffing into a sausage shape running all the way down the middle of the belly. Wrap the sides of the belly around the stuffing and tie with butcher\u2019s string. Place seam-side down in a roasting tin, uncovered, and chill for at least 2 hrs, preferably overnight. You want the skin to dry out completely so that it crisps up when you roast it.",
            "step 7 To cook the pork, remove it from the fridge and leave it for at least 1 hr to come to room temperature before you cook it. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4 and cook the pork for about 2 hrs, turning the tin every 30 mins or so. After 2 hrs, turn the heat up to 220C/ 200C fan/gas 7 and cook for another 20 mins. When the pork is done, a thermometer pushed into its centre should read 77C. If the skin looks in danger of burning, cover it with foil \u2013 but only do this once it has crackled.",
            "step 8 Once the pork has cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 30 mins. When you\u2019re ready to carve, put the pork on a big chopping board. Using a sharp knife, slice the meat into rounds."
