## 📝 Project List

| 📁 Project | 📝 Description | 🏆 Grade |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Chat Bot Implementation** | Developed an AI-powered chatbot using NLP techniques. The chatbot is implemented in Python (`app.py`) and includes pre-processing steps, entity recognition, and response generation. | 16/20 |
| **Deep Learning** | Applied deep learning models for cancer classification. The project contains multiple Jupyter notebooks (`01_df_cleaning.ipynb`, `02_Benign_Malign.ipynb`, `03_CancerType.ipynb`) and a report analyzing CNN architectures for tumor classification. | 16/20 |
| **Genetic Algorithms (GAs) Implementation** | Designed and implemented a genetic algorithm framework. The project (`main.py`) includes optimization techniques, crossover/mutation strategies, and a grid search function for hyperparameter tuning. | 16/20 |
| **Machine Learning Supervised** | Built supervised learning models for classification and regression. The project (`Machine_Learning_Supervised.ipynb`) explores decision trees, random forests, and boosting techniques, with performance evaluation using cross-validation. | 15.39/20 |
| **Machine Learning Unsupervised** | Implemented clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The project includes unsupervised learning models with K-Means, PCA, and DBSCAN, along with a comprehensive report. | 15/20 |
| **Text Mining** | Developed various text mining applications, including sentiment analysis (`2_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`), multilabel classification (`1_Multilabel_Classification.ipynb`) and topic modeling (`4_Topic_Modeling.ipynb`). | 14.60/20 |
